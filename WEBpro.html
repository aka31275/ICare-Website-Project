  <h3>HOME</h3>
  <p><em>I</em>Care is a website that helps patients that suffer from Alzheimers or Amnesia.</p>
  <p>
  Our main goal is to help such people deal with the problem of forgetting important memories. Memories that include family members, birthdays, anniversaries, best friends, themselves, and much more.
  </p>
  <p>
  In order to stop themselves from losing their pressing memories, <em>I</em>Care highly encourages the patients to input memorable events from their day to day life as a journal entry in our attached journal page. Each member has their own user ID which permits them to keep their information private and only for them and their family to access. It is highly recommended that each journal entry be filled with a family memberâ€™s guidance to stop any worries about forgetting their password. At the end of each week they are asked to take a 5 question multiple-choice quiz to see their progress through each week.
  </p>

  <p>
  We organize a meet and greet secession that is held twice a week. This encourages the patients to work hard to get better. Builds up their strength and assurance that they will get better. We will have opportunities for students to volunteer and provide some of their time to collaborate with the patients. Many activities will be held, these activities include dance time, game time, and lastly pet+ time. Dance time is where the volunteers and the patients engage in a small dance activity to build up their physical health. Game time is used to engage all the patients and volunteers with one another, this may consist of pass the ball game, chess, I spy, and many more.
